====================
Django configuration
====================

The first step is to add Bricks to your installed apps::

    # settings.py
    # ...

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'bricks.app',
    ]

You're done :)

(Actually we have to improve this section of our documentation. Come later to
check it out. But seriously, you can use bricks already!)
